# Drone-based Encroachment Detection POC Project

Welcome to the Drone-based Encroachment Detection POC (Proof of Concept) Project! This project was developed as part of the CSE564 Software Design class project at Arizona State University.

## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using drones equipped with object detection capabilities to detect encroachments in restricted areas. The system utilizes Webots for drone simulation, Python for backend logic, and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection.

## Features

- Drone simulation using Webots environment.
- Object detection using the YOLO model.
- Real-time monitoring of the drone's surroundings.
- Alerting system for detecting encroachments.

## Project Structure

- **controllers**: Contains the source code for webot drone controller.
- **worlds**: Contains configuration files and scripts for drone simulation in Webots environment.
- **docs**: Architectural doc related to the project.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (https://www.python.org/)
- Webots (https://cyberbotics.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ameya-shahu/drone-encroachment-detection-poc`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd drone-encroachment-detection-poc`
3. Open folder in Webots.
